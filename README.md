# PHP Microservices Framework
## Introduction
Started by [Olayinka Okewale](https://githb.com/olayinkaokewale), this project was created to make microservices architecture for php developers. Using this framework, you will be able to create standalone APIs which could be called from any platform using any programming language as the request/response is based on JSON.

## Initialization
After cloning this project, follow the following steps to get you started.

- Edit file `engine\config.php` and set the constants to match your localhost database parameters.
- Edit file `engine\online_config.php` and set the constants to match your online server database parameters.
- Open file `engine\engine.class.php` and set the `PRODUCTION` constant to either `true` or `false` based on the environment you are working on.
- Continue working on `engine\engine.class.php` and add more public functions so as to get the tags working.
- (Optional) Check the `engine\Model.php` to know about some basic methods available for easy integration.
